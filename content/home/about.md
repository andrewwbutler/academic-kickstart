# Biography

I am currently a fourth year Ph.D. student in the Genomics and Systems Biology Program at New York University. I work in the lab of Rahul Satija as a computational biologist and am interesting in understanding cell fate decisions throughout differentiation and developing tools for studying this on the single-cell level. 

I completed my B.S. in biology at the University of Texas at Austin where I was a member of the Dean's Scholars honors program.
